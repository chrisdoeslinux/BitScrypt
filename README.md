BitScrypt
=========

An Open Source SHA-256 and Scrpyt mining client based off of Java
This software can be used freely and cloned as wished. I am not responable for any damage to computers due to this software as it will use a large amount of GPU in order to complete SHA-256 and Scrypt. We don't supply a warrenty to this software and their is not offical help center to help deal with issues.
