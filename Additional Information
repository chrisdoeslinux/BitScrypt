This software is totally open source and can be used by anyone. Any source code can be viewed at github.com/chrisdoeslinux/BitScrypt.

This software can not be sold for profit or be bundled with other programs that are said to be "adware". Doing so will result in a pull request and asking that item in question is removed at my request.

Again, this software has not got any warrenty and is in no way responsable for any damage or otherwise harm that may be caused to one's system. It is likely to do a large amount of wear in tear because it is VERY intensive.
